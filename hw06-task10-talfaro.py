# Write a Python script that will calculate the change due, if any, for a given payment and
# for a random cost, based on a given string of coin values. If the payment is made with
# exact change, no change will be due. If the payment is over the total amount, then the
# output will be the change due. If the payment is under the total amount, the output will
# be how much more is needed. Your script should also provide input checking to ensure
# that only digits are being entered and are in the correct format before doing any
# calculations and it should loop continuously until the user enters "quit‚Äù.
# Input string                                  Exxpected output of script
