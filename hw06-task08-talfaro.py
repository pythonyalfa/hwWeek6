# Write a Python script that will calculate the change due, if any, for a given payment if the
# total cost is $16.48, based on the following table of coin values. If the payment is made
# with exact change, no change will be due. If the paymentis over the total amount, then
# the output will be the change due. If the paymentis under the total amount, the output
# will be how much more is needed. Your script should also provide input checking to
# ensure that only digits are being entered and are in the correct format before doing any
# calculations.
